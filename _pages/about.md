🏫-  I am currently a PhD student in [Advanced Computing Architecture Team](https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT), South China University of Technology(SCUT). I am also a senior member in [Oneslab](https://oneslab.github.io/) and [Entroplay Intelligence Lab](https://entroplay.ai/).


🔬-  My research is mostly about MLLMs. I am particularly interested in multimodal RAG, long-term memory agents, and world models.


📫-  I am looking to collaborate on high impact research ideas that would provide foundational insights or resources for the research community. Feel free to reach out to my [gmail](peter20030725@gmail.com).
